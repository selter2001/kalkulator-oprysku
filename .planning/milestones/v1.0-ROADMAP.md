# Roadmap: Kalkulator Oprysku

## Overview

Transform an existing 12-file flat SwiftUI spray calculator into an App Store-ready professional app. The work divides into three phases: first restructure into MVVM with clean architecture and complete the missing calculation features, then apply a coordinated visual theme system for dark mode and field readiness, and finally add PDF export and package everything for App Store submission. Each phase delivers a coherent, verifiable capability that builds on the previous one.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation & MVVM** - Restructure codebase into MVVM, migrate to @Observable, fix localization bugs, add per-tank composition calculations
- [x] **Phase 2: Visual Polish** - Coordinated dark mode via Asset Catalog, Dynamic Type support, field-ready high-contrast styling
- [x] **Phase 3: Export & App Store Prep** - PDF export with ImageRenderer, About view, README/LICENSE, zero warnings, correct Bundle ID

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation & MVVM
**Goal**: Users get accurate per-tank composition breakdowns (water + chemical for full and partial tanks) from a cleanly architected MVVM app with all localization bugs fixed
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CALC-01, CALC-02, CALC-03, UI-04, FIX-01, FIX-02, FIX-03, FIX-04, FIX-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After calculating, user sees how many liters of water and how many liters of chemical to pour into each full tank
  2. After calculating, user sees how many liters of water and how many liters of chemical to pour into the last partial tank
  3. After calculating, user sees total amount of chemical to buy for the entire field
  4. Switching app language to English shows fully English UI on every screen -- no hardcoded Polish text remains in history rows or settings
  5. All existing features work identically: history, favorites, tractor animation, unit switching, input validation with haptic feedback
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Skopiowanie kodu, usuniecie martwego pliku, migracja @Observable + DI
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — SprayCalculatorService, rozszerzenie modelu, CalcViewModel z logika obliczen
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Integracja CalcViewModel z widokiem, 3 nowe ResultCards (per-tank composition)
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Naprawa lokalizacji (HistoryRowView, SettingsView, TractorAnimation) + weryfikacja

### Phase 2: Visual Polish
**Goal**: App looks professional in both light and dark mode with high-contrast field-ready styling that remains readable in bright sunlight and at all Dynamic Type sizes
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (MVVM structure must be in place before replacing colors across all views)
**Requirements**: UI-01, UI-02, UI-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Toggling iOS dark mode produces a fully adapted UI with no white-on-white or invisible text on any screen
  2. Setting Dynamic Type to maximum accessibility size keeps all screens usable -- no text clipping, no overlapping elements, all content scrollable
  3. In bright outdoor light, all input labels, buttons, and result numbers are clearly readable due to high-contrast field-ready color palette
  4. No hardcoded Color literals remain in any view file -- all colors reference Asset Catalog semantic names
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Asset Catalog color sets (18 colorsets with light/dark), AppGradients.swift, Components.swift full migration
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Migrate remaining 5 views, delete Colors.swift, human-verify dark mode + Dynamic Type + readability

### Phase 3: Export & App Store Prep
**Goal**: Users can export calculation results as a professional PDF document, view author information, and the app is packaged for App Store submission with zero warnings
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (clean SprayResult model for PDF data), Phase 2 (styled views inform PDF design choices)
**Requirements**: EXP-01, EXP-02, EXP-03, EXP-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can tap an export button after calculating and receive a shareable PDF containing inputs, results, per-tank breakdown, date, and author signature "Wojciech Olszak"
  2. User can open an "About" screen showing author name, app version, and contact information
  3. Repository contains a professional README.md with build instructions and screenshot placeholders, plus an MIT LICENSE file
  4. Project builds with zero Xcode warnings, correct Bundle Identifier, and deploys successfully to a physical iPhone
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — PDFExportService + PDFContentView + ShareLink + 6 nowych lokalizacji
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — AboutView, README.md, LICENSE, Bundle ID fix, zero-warnings, human-verify
